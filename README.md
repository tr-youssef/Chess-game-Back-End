# Chess-game-Back-End

The goal of this project is to create a functional API for a text-based interactive application using HTTP APIs and the JavaScript framework, ExpressJS. The purpose is to make your thinking visible through a series of iteration and feedback cycles, enabling you to build an API that is both effective and efficient. One of the primary constraints of this project is that we will not be using any frontend technologies. This means that we will need to focus on designing a backend system that can effectively handle user requests and deliver the appropriate responses. To achieve this goal, we will need to carefully consider how we design and implement our API endpoints, ensuring that they are easy to use and efficient. Through this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of how HTTP APIs work, and how we can use them to create powerful and effective backend systems.

## Run the API

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tr-youssef/Chess-game-Back-End.git
```

Install the dependencies

```bash
cd API
npm install
cd ..
cd Terminal
npm install
```

Create .env file in your API Folder

```bash
cd ..
cd API
touch .env
```
Open your .env file and put the text below (don't forget to add your mongoDB connection url)

```python
PORT = 3000
DB_URL =  YOUR MONGODB CONNECTION URL
```

Run the application

```bash
cd API
npm start
cd ..
cd Terminal
npm start
```
